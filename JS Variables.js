// javascript variables
// Variables are containers(storage areas)used to hold data. num is a variable, it is storing 5.
let num = 5;
console.log(num)

// JavaScript Declare Variables
// In JavaScript, we use either var or let keyword to declare variables.
let x;
var y;
// Here, x and y are variables.

// We use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.
let p = 5;
let q = 6;
// it is also possible to declare variables in a single statement
let d= 5; e = 6; f = 10; 

// If you use a variable without initializing it, it will have an undefined value.
let g; // x is the name of the variable

console.log(x); // undefined

// It's possible to change the value stored in the variable. For example
// 5 is assigned to variable x
let b = 22; 
b = 12;
// Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $. For example,
let a = "hello!";
let _a = "hello!";
let $a = "hello!";
console.log(_a);
